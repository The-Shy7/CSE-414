I actually had a very good experience using Azure. It's much more reliable than sqlite.
It automatically shows query results in an organized manner rather than manually setting 
the presentation of the results as in sqlite. However, I disliked the fact that I couldn't
export the results in an organized table format and I was forced to export them as csv files. 
Also, I disliked how my queries were not saved locally within the database, so I could easily
access them again and I was forced to save my queries on my desktop and copy and paste the code
into Azure to test it again. Other than these small inconveniences, it was a good experience. 
Since we need to deal with very large amounts of data, it is very inefficient to work and manage
it locally on our computers, so utilizing clouds service DBMSs such as Azure provides us the means
through which we can work with big data. We can't store this much data on our computers, so cloud
services for data storage is a huge necessity. Overall, I believe that the idea of offering a DBMS 
as a service in a public cloud is necessary tool for storing large amounts of data and building
interactions between the clients and server.
